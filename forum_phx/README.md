## Create a JSON resource

example command

```sh
mix phx.gen.json Posts Post posts body:string title:string
```

This command is used in Elixir's Phoenix framework to generate a JSON resource. Here's a breakdown:

* **mix**: This is Elixir's build tool. It's used to create, compile, and test your application, manage its dependencies, and much more.
* **phx.gen.json**: This is a mix task provided by Phoenix. It's used to generate a JSON resource, which includes a controller, model, and views.
* **Posts**: This is the context module where the generated files will be placed. If it doesn't exist, it will be created.
* **Post**: This is the schema module that will be created. It represents the data structure of the posts.
* **posts**: This is the database table that will be created.
* **body:string title:string**: These are the columns that will be added to the posts table. The format is column_name:type. In this case, two columns will be created, body and title, both of type string.

So, in short, this command will generate a new JSON resource in the Posts context with a Post schema, a posts table, and body and title as string columns.
